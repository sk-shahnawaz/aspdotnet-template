## Application Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable Name | Help Text |
|---------------|-----------|
| SENTRY_RELEASE | Sentry release number |
| SENTRY_MINIMUM_EVENT_LEVEL | Minimum logging level for Sentry |
| SERILOG_LOGGING_LEVEL | Minimum logging level for Serilog |
| SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT | Sentry environment |
| ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT | ASP.NET Core environment |
| SENTRY_DSN | Sentry DSN |
| USE_IN_MEMORY_DATABASE | [true/false], when set to true, application uses in-memory database, when set to false, tries to configure and use PostgreSQL / SQL Server database as per configuration |
| IN_MEMORY_DATABASE_NAME | Name of the in-memory database, considered only when '*USE_IN_MEMORY_DATABASE*' is set to *true* |
| USE_POSTGRESQL_DB | [true/false], when set to true, application configures and uses PostgreSQL as persisitent medium, note that this works only when '*USE_IN_MEMORY_DATABASE*' is set to *false* |
| USE_SQLSERVER_DB | [true/false], when set to true, application configures and uses Microsoft SQL Server as persisitent medium, note that this works only when '*USE_IN_MEMORY_DATABASE*' is set to *false*, furthermore, when both PostgrSQL & SQL Server are enabled, PostgreSQL will get higher preference |
| ENABLE_ODATA | [true/false], when set to true, application adds OData functionality for selection, sorting on top of Web API, when set to false, disables this feature |
| PGHOST | PostgreSQL host name |
| PGPORT | PostgreSQL port number |
| PGPASSWORD | PostgreSQL password |
| PGUSER | PostgreSQL user name |
| PGDATABASE | PostgreSQL database name |
| PGVERSION | PostgreSQL version |
| SQLHOST | SQL Server host name |
| SQLPORT | SQL Server port number |
| SQLPASSWORD | SQL Server password |
| SQLUSER | SQL Server user name |
| SQLDATABASE | SQL Server database name |
| NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME | Application name for tracking in New Relic web UI |
| NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY | New relic license key |

### Scope Handling in ASP.NET Core

If, from a controller action, an operation (method) is invoked on a Thread Pool Task to run as a background work, then by the time
control comes in that method, the caller controller action method finishes executing and thus runtime disposes all dependent objects
like database context. In order to use such dependent objects we have to pass an instance of IServiceScopeFactory and then obtain a new
scope which then can be used to get the required dependent object.
